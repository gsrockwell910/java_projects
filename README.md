                                 Encryption Interface Project
                                 
The goal of this project is to create an interface called Crypto 
that will have methods to encrypt and decrypt a string,
then create two demo programs implementing the Crypto interface in two different ways.

                                 Project Requirements
                                 
1. Crypto interface must have both an encrypt and decrypt method.
2. Must use a substitution algorithm for encryption and decryption.
3. Encrypt method accepts a string argument and returns an encrypted version of that string.
4. Decrypt method accepts an encrypted string as an argument and returns a decrypted version of that string.
5. Must use two classes, Cipher1 and Cipher2 to demonstrate the Crypto interface.
6. Both Cipher1 and Cipher2 must implement the Crypto interface using different substitution algorithms.
